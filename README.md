# VehiclePolymorphism  12/01/2023
Series of exercises done regularly to keep me practiced and deepen my java knowledge

Exercise: Create a "Vehicle" class with methods for "accelerate()" and "brake()" and two subclasses "Car" and "
Motorcycle" that inherit from "Vehicle" and override the methods for printing "Auto accelerate" and " Auto brakes" or "
Motorcycle accelerates" and "Motorcycle brakes", respectively. Create a "Salable" interface with a "price()" method and
have "Cars" and "Bikes" implement this interface. Create a "Dealership" class that contains an array of "Vehicle"
objects that can be sold and a "Pricelist()" method that uses polymorphism to print the price of each vehicle in the
array, by calling the "price()" method through a "Salable" type reference.
